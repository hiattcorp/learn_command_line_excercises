n colors,
In colors the fields are dressed
In the springtime

In colors,
Colorful are the little birds
That come from far away1

In colors,
Colorful is the rainbow
That we see shine

And that is why the great loves
of many colors are pleasing to me (3Xs)

Sings the rooster,
Sings the rooster with the
Cock-a-doodle-do, cock-a-doodle do...

The hen,
The hen with the
Cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck, cluck...

The baby chicks,
The baby chicks with the
Peep, peep, peep, peep...

And that is why the great loves
of many colors are pleasing to me (3Xs)
